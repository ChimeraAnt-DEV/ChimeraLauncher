/**
 * Pure decision logic for the Select Hit module.
 *
 * <p>Bedrock gives an attack a short invulnerability window after it lands: a second click
 * inside that window is discarded, so a player who spam-clicks actually lands <em>fewer</em>
 * hits than one who waits for the window to close. This solver tracks the timestamps of the
 * player's own attack input and reports when the next hit can land.
 *
 * <p>Honest scope: this is a metronome over input the player already produced. It cannot read
 * the server's cooldown, cannot make a hit land, and does not click for the player — it tells
 * the player when their own next click will count, which is the same information a practiced
 * player carries in their head.
 *
 * <p>No Android or game types here on purpose: the timing rules are unit-testable on their own,
 * and the overlay is a thin renderer over {@link Decision}.
